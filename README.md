## üìñ About The Project

Online shopping lacks transparency. Consumers have no visibility into the carbon emissions generated by the products they purchase, from manufacturing to shipping. **CarbonWise** tackles this problem head-on.

It allows users to paste a URL from e-commerce sites. Our backend scrapes the product data, and an AI/ML model instantly calculates its estimated carbon footprint. We also recommend greener alternatives, empowering eco-friendly choices.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Instant analysis via URL** - Simply paste any e-commerce product link
- ‚úÖ **AI-powered carbon footprint estimates** - Advanced ML models calculate emissions
- ‚úÖ **Green recommendations** - Discover eco-friendlier alternatives
- ‚úÖ **Downloadable reports** - Export detailed carbon analysis
- ‚úÖ **Smart Selenium-based scraping** - Reliable product data extraction
- ‚úÖ **Dual-mode support** - Built for both consumers & businesses

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Enter product URL** - Paste any e-commerce product link
2. **Data extraction** - Scraper extracts weight, dimensions, materials
3. **ML analysis** - TensorFlow model estimates carbon emissions
4. **Results dashboard** - View comprehensive carbon footprint analysis
5. **Green alternatives** - Browse suggested eco-friendly products
6. **Export report** - Download detailed analysis as PDF/CSV
